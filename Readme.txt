# README – Connect 4 Project (meme version)

## What is this
A classic **Connect 4**, but with a different style.

## Features
- Detects who wins (red or yellow) and also if there is a draw.
- The pieces are not boring: we use popular culture images (memes).
- Background with **video** and **music** to keep the chosen style.
- **Reset** button to start again when you lose and want a rematch.

## Style
- Bright colors, small shadows on the pieces, and thick lines to give strong visual impact to the board.
- Big and flashy messages: “Red Wins!”, “Yellow Wins!”, or “Draw!”.
- Everything centered as if it were an arcade game.
- We selected background music that matches the board image. In addition, the video acts as a handicap to distract players and make thinking more frustrating.
